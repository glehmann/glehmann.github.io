title: Back to blogging, with Jekyll
---

I've been quite busy in the last years — 2 children (conceived by [IVF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation)),
a new job, two new homes — that didn't let me much time for blogging. The lack of stable IP at my new homes
for my self hosted blog finally completely took my blog off line.

I keep trying a few fun things though, that I can't necessarily find in all these
amazing blogs on the internet. I feel I should make these things available
somewhere, instead of keeping them for me.

Things have changed quite a lot since my last attempt at blogging. More
specifically, my blogging tool [nanoblogger], is gone.
But a lot of alternative are there! I've chosen [Jekyll]
with [Lanyon]. The theme is nice and clean and it integrates very easily with
[GitHub Pages] — goodbye hosting problems!
It is also a lot faster then [nanoblogger], and I feel right at home with
the [markdown syntax] and the directory layout.

The few missing things were found on [Joshua Lande's blog] or created from scratch.

What was done can be found in [my GitHub repository].
A few steps that may be useful for others:

* [add a link to the atom feed in the side bar](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/2a3e867)
* [add the archive page with entries grouped by year](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/0157663)
* [add my gravatar to the side bar](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/2bd8284)
* [use `defaults` to avoid putting `layout` (and later `comments`) in the front matter of each post](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/ecf47bf)
* [add discuss comments](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/a3da95c)
* [side bar overlay](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/8d6b2cd)
* [add a sitemap](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/6e824cb)
* [add a tags page](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/0fa4566)
* [slightly reduce the font size](https://github.com/glehmann/glehmann.github.io/commit/fdba01e)
