title: Date format
---

All around the world, we are using some conventions to write short dates, and it seem that, despite
the variations, none of us is using a nice convention. IMHO, a nice convention must (in addition to
code the date):

* order the different elements in a logical way
* be easy to sort — a lexicographic sort should work

The US format (mm-dd-yyy) seems to be one of the worth: none of those two simple criteria are
reached. The french one (dd/mm/yyyy) is a little better — the order of the elements is logical —
but it fails for the second criteria.

The best one seems to be the one nobody use excepted in the computer world: yyyy-mm-dd.
That's the one I'm using for that blog.
