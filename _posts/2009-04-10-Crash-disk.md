title: Crash disk
---

No luck on my current linux workstation: just a few weeks before the arrival of the new one, one of the hard drive has died. I have a backup of my home on that host, so I shouldn't have lost anything I can't reproduce, but I'll spend an entire day — and perhaps more — to reinstall everything needed to work.

No doubt, an additional disk for data redundancy is worth the cost.
