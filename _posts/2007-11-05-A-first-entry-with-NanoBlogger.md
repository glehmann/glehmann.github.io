title: A first entry with NanoBlogger

My first try of NanoBlogger!

I finally decided to communicate with the world, and let everyone ear the voices in my head.
I have a computer, an internet access, a poor english... the only missing thing was a soft to manage
my blog. I looked at the most common ones — word press, dotclear, etc. — but always found them too much
complex for the simple use I'm planning to have. The ability to write the posts offline was also
a *must have* for me.
Finally, I found [NanoBlogger][1]. It's tiny, full featured,
works offline, doesn't even require PHP or MySQL and supports utf-8 and various editing syntaxes — seems to
be *just what I need*.
