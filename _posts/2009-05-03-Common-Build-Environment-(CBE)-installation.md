title: Common Build Environment (CBE) installation
---

I've just installed CBE with the instruction from [Setting up your own build environment] on the [The SourceJuicer Blog]. This is a required step to contribute reproducible packages based on `spec files`.

It's a bit strange to have to go that way to be able to build packages. In all other distro, the packaging tools are packaged with the dedicated packaging system and as easy to install as any other package. I guess this is a script made when [IPS] wasn't there, and that we may have a cleaner install later.
