title: Bad news, good news
---

The result of two of our project proposals came back yesterday.

Bad news: none of them are accepted. We won't have the position for a new engineer with whom I would have worked, and my team won't be able to make all the experiments they'd like to :-(

Good news: none of them are accepted. I'll have some time to complete some of my long standing projects, like the one on [component trees], and maybe I'll be able to get more involved in the biology work in my team :-)

Finally, it may be a quite neutral resultâ€¦
