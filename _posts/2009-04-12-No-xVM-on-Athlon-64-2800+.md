title: No xVM on Athlon 64 2800+
---

Virtualization is a nice feature for a developer â€” it allows to run many systems on the same host to run daily tests and fix platform specific potential problems. OpenSolaris comes with xVM out of the box, so I've tried this solution.

I've first installed the required packages

    pkg install xvm-gui

and created a new boot environment

    beadm create -a os-111

then changed the grub entry in `/rpool/boot/grub/menu.lst` to

    title os-111
    findroot (pool_rpool,0,a)
    bootfs rpool/ROOT/os-111
    kernel$ /boot/$ISADIR/xen.gz
    module$ /platform/i86xpv/kernel/$ISADIR/unix /platform/i86xpv/kernel/$ISADIR/unix -B $ZFS-BOOTFS,console=text
    module$ /platform/i86pc/$ISADIR/boot_archive

a reboot on that new boot environment, then activation of the xvm services

    svcadm enable -r xvm/virtd
    svcadm enable -r xvm/domains

and finally the configuration of the new virtual machine with the GUI

    pfexec virt-manager

and that's all: my processor does not support full virtualization :-(

I just rolled back to the previous boot environment.
